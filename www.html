        <h2 class="h21"> What is the World Wide Web?</h2>
            <p class="wwwintro"> Many people think that the internet and the world wide web are the same thing. While they
                are closely linked, they are very different systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                The internet is a huge network of computers all connected together. The world wide web (‘www’ or ‘web’
                for short) is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers. Your web browser uses the
                internet to access the web.</p>

            <h2 class="h22"> How did the Web begin?</h2>
            <p class="wwwp1">In 1989 the world wide web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was trying to find a new way for scientists to easily share the data from their experiments.
<br>
<br>
                Hypertext and the internet already existed at this point but no one had thought of a way to use the internet to link one document directly to another.
                <br>
                <br>
                Berners-Lee suggested three main technologies (HTML, HTTP, URL) that would allow for all computers to process and understand one another.
